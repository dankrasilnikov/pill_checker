      **Note**: The MeSH knowledge base (KB) is derived directly from MeSH itself and, as such, uses different

    - **RxNorm**: Links to the RxNorm ontology. RxNorm contains ~100k concepts focused on normalized names
      for clinical drugs. It includes several other drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management
      and drug interaction, such as First Databank, Micromedex, and the Gold Standard Drug Database.
    - **GO**: Links to the Gene Ontology. The Gene Ontology contains ~67k concepts focused on the biological
      functions of genes.
    - **HPO**: Links to the Human Phenotype Ontology. The Human Phenotype Ontology contains ~16k concepts
      focused on phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human diseases.
